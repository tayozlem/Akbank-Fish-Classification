## Overview
This project is a classification task where different species of fish are identified using images. The main goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can classify fish species with high accuracy. The model used is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is well-suited for image classification tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of various fish species. The data was sourced from the [Kaggle Fish Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ozlemtay/fish-classification-deep-learning). It includes images of multiple fish species, which are used for both training and testing the model.

- **Training set**: Contains images with labels indicating the species of the fish.
- **Test set**: Used to evaluate the model's performance.

## Model Architecture
The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Key layers and techniques used in the architecture include:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from the input images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for classification.
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU for non-linearity and softmax for output.
- **Dropout**: To prevent overfitting.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss, given that it's a multi-class classification problem.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you'll need to have Python installed. You can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fish-classification-deep-learning.git
    cd fish-classification-deep-learning
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ozlemtay/fish-classification-deep-learning) and place it in the `data/` directory.

4. Run the model:
    ```bash
    python fish_classification.py
    ```

## Usage
Once you have installed the dependencies and set up the dataset, you can train the model by running the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

You can also evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **X%** on the test set after training. The following metrics were also recorded:

- **Precision**: 
- **Recall**: 
- **F1-score**: 

## Future Improvements
Possible future improvements for this project include:

- **Data Augmentation**: To increase the size of the training data and improve generalization.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: To further optimize the modelâ€™s performance.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG for better results.
